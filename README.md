# Getting Started with the Cat Gallery App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project Description

The Cat Gallery App is a beautiful and responsive web application that fetches images from the Cat API and displays them with a visually appealing user interface. This application offers various features, including infinite scrolling, image loading indicators, full-view display of images, and smooth transitions for a seamless user experience. 

The app is fully responsive and adapts to all screen sizes, ensuring an optimal browsing experience across devices, including mobile, tablet, and desktop.

## Key Features

1. **Infinite Scroll**: The app fetches more cat images as you scroll down, making sure you never run out of adorable cat photos.

2. **Loading Indicator**: Displays a loader while waiting for the API to fetch more images, providing a smooth user experience.

3. **Full-View Display**: When an image is clicked, it opens in its original dimensions in a full-view modal, allowing you to appreciate the details.

4. **Responsive UI**: The app is designed to be fully responsive, adapting to all screen sizes. In mobile view, the images are displayed in a single column with the infinite scroll feature intact.

5. **Smooth Transitions and Hover Effects**: Enjoy a more interactive experience with subtle hover and transition effects on the cat images.

6. **React Router Integration**: Utilizes React Router to navigate between the home page and the main cat gallery page effortlessly.
